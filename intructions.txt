Note: I uploaded the .env file so that we can easily setup and run the application.

#1. Build docker images
    docker-compose build
#2. Run the app containers
    docker-compose up -d
#3. Install laravel dependecies
    docker-compose exec app composer install
#4. Run migrations
    docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
#5. Run automated tests
    docker-compose exec app php artisan test
#6. Testing api via swagger api docs

  copy the file contents of api-docs.yml on the root directory of this project.
  Then go to https://editor.swagger.io/ and paste the content in that editor.

Enjoy playing around on the api docs. ðŸ™‚
