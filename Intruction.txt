Permissions Issues

If you encounter any issues with filesystem permissions while visiting your application or running a container command, try completing one of the sets of steps below.

If you are using your server or local environment as the root user:

    Bring any container(s) down with docker-compose down
    Rename docker-compose.root.yml file to docker-compose.root.yml, replacing the previous one
    Re-build the containers by running docker-compose build --no-cache

If you are using your server or local environment as a user that is not root:

    Bring any container(s) down with docker-compose down
    In your terminal, run export UID=$(id -u) and then export GID=$(id -g)
    If you see any errors about readonly variables from the above step, you can ignore them and continue
    Re-build the containers by running docker-compose build --no-cache

Then, either bring back up your container network or re-run the command you were trying before, and see if that fixes it.
